# pattern match

[diary] about how to implement pattern match

# any type

[lisp] fix the use of any type for functions like `equal?` and `assert-equal`

# optional type

[lisp] maybe use `maybe-t`
[lisp] support `OptionalType` -- fix `builtin/index.lisp`

# later

[pass] `desugarCond` -- report `error` about mismatch -- instead of `assert`
